# OverwatchAimTriggerBotV2 (SKLearn Project for AHCS)

## Features
1. Flashbang Analyzer -> Records when flashbang is available and shows red or green screen on other monitor whether cooldown is available or not
2. Ammo Counter -> Works best for McCree. Reads ammunition off screen and puts in center of flashbang analyzer window. (More of a cool feature than useful feature)
3. TriggerBot -> Please don't use in competitive. OpenCV addon to demonstrate how speed is sometimes the best way to go about something, rather than using the most complicated machine learning models which did not work for the triggerbot nearly as well as in the current version. (EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES :)
